## What is this & Why?
Amazon allows you to reload your account balance (aka purchasing a gift card for yourself) for as low as $0.50.

Many credit cards will close your account for inactivity if you do not use it for a while. When this happens:

- It causes a dip in your credit score, especially if it is your oldest account.
- It leaves a semi-permanent mark on your credit report for up to 10 years.

Some other credit cards, like the Bilt Mastercard, require you to make a minimum number of purchases to unlock the best rewards.

Some banks require a minimum number of purchases to get the best interest rates or avoid fees.

Many people buy small Amazon gift card reloads to meet these requirements easily. Since a lot of people use Amazon anyway, the reloaded balance eventually gets spent.

This browser extension aims to automate this process of making small reloading purchases to make it even easier!
